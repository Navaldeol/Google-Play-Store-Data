# Google-Play-Store-Data
-This data set was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps . I have also included a copy of the data in the repository. 

Using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib modules, I set out to simplify and present common statistics of the Google Play Store.

To view the file, please run with the Jupyter Notebook. 

Thank You
